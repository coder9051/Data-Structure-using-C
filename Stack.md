# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.

In stacks, the insertion and deletion of elements happen only at one endpoint of it.

## How to understand stack practically
You can think of the stack data structure as the pile of plates on top of another.

Here, you can:

* Put a new plate on top
* Remove the top plate

And, if you want the plate at the bottom, you must first remove all the plates on top. This is exactly how the stack data structure works.

## Methods to implement Stack in C
* **Statically**: Array implementation of stacks allows the static memory allocation of its data elements. It is important to note that in this method, the stack acquires all the features of an array.
* **Dynamically**: Linked list implementation of stacks follow the dynamic memory allocation of its data elements. It is important to note that in this method, the stack inherits all the characteristics of a linked list in C.

## Operations performed on stack

### Push : Adding an element onto the stack
In a stack, the operation of inserting an element into the stack is referred to as pushing an element in the stack. The elements are inserted into the stack from the top and hence would compel the elements to shift.

Stack is overflown when we try to insert an element into a completely filled stack therefore, our main function must always avoid stack overflow condition.
