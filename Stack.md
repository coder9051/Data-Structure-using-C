# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure. It follows the last in first out approach. A new item is added at the top of a stack. Both insert and deletion operation is performed from one end of the stack.

There are two functions associated with stacks. Push function to add elements to the stack and pop function to remove elements from the stack.
